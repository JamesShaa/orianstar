# Flash Fix Summary - No More Brief Website Glimpse

## Problem Solved
Fixed the issue where users saw a brief flash of another website for 2-3 seconds before your main site loaded.

## Root Causes Identified & Fixed

### 1. **Incorrect Meta Tags**
- **Fixed**: Open Graph URL was pointing to `https://playorionstars.net` instead of your domain
- **Fixed**: Canonical URL was pointing to wrong domain
- **Result**: Browsers and social media were getting confused about the correct URL

### 2. **Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC)**
- **Added**: Critical CSS inline in the HTML head
- **Added**: Visibility control to prevent content from showing until fully styled
- **Result**: No more flash of unstyled content

### 3. **Server Configuration**
- **Added**: DirectoryIndex directive to ensure root index.html loads first
- **Added**: Server signature hiding for cleaner loading
- **Result**: Server serves the correct file immediately

## Technical Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Meta Tag Corrections**
```html
<!-- Before -->
<meta property="og:url" content="https://playorionstars.net" />
<link rel="canonical" href="https://playorionstars.net" />

<!-- After -->
<meta property="og:url" content="https://orionstarsgame.vip" />
<link rel="canonical" href="https://orionstarsgame.vip" />
```

### 2. **Critical CSS Inlined**
- Moved essential CSS directly into HTML head
- Added visibility control to prevent flash
- Ensures consistent styling from first paint

### 3. **JavaScript Loading Control**
```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    document.body.classList.add('loaded');
});
```

### 4. **Server Configuration (.htaccess)**
```apache
# Ensure root index.html loads first
DirectoryIndex index.html

# Hide server signature
ServerSignature Off
```
